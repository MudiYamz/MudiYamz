### 👋 Hi, I’m @MudiYamz

My name is Mudi, I am an Economics and International Business Graduate (earning a Bachelor's Degree and Master's Degree respectively), and I am interested in all things Python & Data Science.

I am also looking to start by making a web scrapping tool for providing financial information on alternative investments including Art, Real Estate, and other non-conventional investment instruments.
- 👩🏻‍🤝‍👨🏿 Also looking to collaborate to make YouTube Videos for my Art company which I founded called Freshlemonwater.
