### 👋 Hi, I’m @MudiYamz

My name is Mudi, I am an Economics and International Business Graduate (earning a Bachelor's Degree and Master's Degree respectively), and also a certified project management practitioner. I love managing projects, all things Python, Data Science, and Big Data, and on the side, I take a deep dive into contemporary art forms.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and looking to get experience as a Python junior developer for data analysis.

- 👩🏻‍🤝‍👨🏿 Also looking to collaborate to improve the UI/UX for my Art company which I created called Freshlemonwater. (FYI I designed and built the website)

  To contact me on anything related to project management, python, or my work in the arts you can send an email to mudi@freshlemonwater.com
