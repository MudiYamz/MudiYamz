### 👋 Hi, I’m @MudiYamz

My name is Mudi, I am an Economics and International Business Graduate (earning a Bachelor's Degree and Master's Degree respectively), and I am interested in all things Python & Data Science.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and looking to get experience as a Python junior developer for data analysis.

- 👩🏻‍🤝‍👨🏿 Also looking to collaborate to make YouTube Videos/content for my Art company which I created called Freshlemonwater. I also designed and built the website.
